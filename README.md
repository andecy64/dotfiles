##Fishfur's dotfile private collection!
These configuration files are used with packages
listed in .pkglist, and on archlinux-x86_64.
If you are using a different system they probably wont
work.

Planned changes:

- [ ] Configure tmux and build a script for autostarting vim as ide.
- [ ] Seperate i3, urxvt-unicode to submodules for portability.
- [ ] Configure custom bash-it files (for bobby-python and python prompt).
- [ ] Set up i3blocks scripts.
- [ ] Seperate .pkglist files further, check for inconsistencies.
